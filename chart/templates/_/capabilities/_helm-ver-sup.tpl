Returns true if the used Helm version is 3.3+.
A way to check the used Helm version was not introduced until version 3.3.0 with .Capabilities.HelmVersion, which contains an additional "{}}"  structure.
This check is introduced as a regexMatch instead of {{ if .Capabilities.HelmVersion }} because checking for the key HelmVersion in <3.3 results in a "interface not found" error.
**To be removed when the catalog's minimun Helm version is 3.3**
